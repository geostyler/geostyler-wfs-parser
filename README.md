[GeoStyler](https://github.com/geostyler/geostyler/) Data Parser implementation for Web Feature Services (WFS)


### Issues
Please provide related issues here https://github.com/geostyler/geostyler/issues

### Info
Currently, WFS service must support `application/json` as outputFormat and its application server must be configured to send CORS headers (only needed if WFS Service is not located on the same origin as the component using this parser)
